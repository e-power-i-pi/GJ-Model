# GJ-Model
Modelling the GJ charge density for a pulsar

In this piece of code we try to model the absolute Goldreich and Julian charge density (as formulated in Battye et al. 2021 and G&J 1969) and look at the distribution as a function of the misalignment angle (given by ɑ) and the observing angle (given by θ).
The power of the resonant axion signal is directly proportional to the probability of resonant conversion which, in turns, is inversely proportional to the plasmic effects that happen in the magnetosphere of a Neutron star. 
These plasmic effects are governed by the charges present, which is given by GJ charge density distribution. 
Therefore, these charge depleated regions are of prime interest to us as the probability and intensity of axion signal that could come from these zones would have a higher value.
